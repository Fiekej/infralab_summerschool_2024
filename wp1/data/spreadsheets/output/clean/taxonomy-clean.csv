Our view is that the future success of quantum computing critically depends on advances at the most fundamental level, and that large-scale investments in quantum implementations will only pay off if they can draw on additional foundational insights and ideas. While several powerful quantum algorithms are known, the basic techniques they employ are few and far between. Largely, it still remains to be discovered how to systematically harness the quantum for computation. We study four areas of quantum phenomenology: (i) Quantum contextuality, non-classicality, and quantum advantage, (ii) Complexity of classical simulation of quantum computation, (iii) Arithmetic of quantum circuits, and (iv) Efficiency of fault-tolerant quantum computation.These fields are chosen for two reasons. First, their progress is of great importance for the physical realisation and the broad applicability of quantum computation. Regarding (i), one of the simplest proofs of quantum contextuality, Merminâ€™s star, has recently been employed to prove (Bravyi, Gosset, KÃ¶nig) that bounded-depth quantum circuits are more powerful than their classical analogues. We seek to expand this result beyond bounded depth. In (ii), we study the quantum speedup by shaving off the redundant part â€“ the efficiently classically simulable. In (iii), we aim to provide more efficient techniques for gate and circuit synthesis, utilising the number-theoretic underpinnings of the problem. Regarding (iv), given the celebrated threshold theorem, and the fact that the error threshold is now known to be within reach of experiment, we will tackle the remaining challenge of reducing the cost of fault tolerance.The second reason for selecting the above work areas is to mine them for foundational quantum mechanical structures and find related quantum algorithmic uses.",2022-08-26 02:22:20,10.3030/101070558,International cooperation with Canada (RIA),Digital & Emerging Technologies for Competitiveness and Fit for the Green Deal,"advanced computing and big data,quantum technologies"

The current state of the art for (the few) edge-AI chips relies on low-cost process technologies at 90 or 40nm and in some cases up to 16nm, with power efficiency between 1-5 TOPS/w and power densities up to 1 TOPS/mm2.Recently several industrial projects and a few products have started to surface pursing neuromorphic and in memory computing, but none of these efforts have reached a level of maturity compatible with a mass volume production and cost, and, moreover the technology base they rely on is either not scalable to more advanced nodes (flash) or, targeting AI computing algorithms whose practical applications are yet to be fully proven (e.g., spiking). The NeuroSoC approach instead is to rely on a solid, mature, and qualified reliable Phase Change Memory technology to create an industrially proven path to go past the state of the art, as such, the NeuroSoC chip pre-product demonstration of the technology will be the first of his kind worldwide.NeuroSoCâ€™s aim is to develop an advanced Multi-Processor System on Chip prototype in FD-SOI 28nm CMOS technology that tightly integrates an AIMC IMNPU unit, a local digital processing subsystem, and functional safe multiprocessor host subsystems based on an enhanced version of existing RISC-V microprocessor implementation, while covering IMNPU security aspects holistically to tackle the requirements of a wide set of edge-AI applications.The project will leverage STMicroelectronicsâ€™s unique high-density embedded PCM cell process technology being the denser and only such technology qualified and mature for embedded use in the industry world",2022-08-23 21:33:37,10.3030/101070634,"Ultra-low-power, secure processors for edge computing (RIA)",Digital & Emerging Technologies for Competitiveness and Fit for the Green Deal,"manufacturing technologies,artificial intelligence,advanced computing and big data"

With an annual growth in waste of 2%, this group is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the EU, while less than 40% of electronic waste is recycled within the EU. There is a need to explore new options for electronics that are designed for reuse, repair, and high-quality recycling. To address this challenge, several factors must be considered such as the Industrial End Userâ€™s (IEU) specifications, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and the products end-of-life (EoL). Printed electronics (PE) is an additive manfucaturing method that can address these challenges and is characterized by its versatility, scalability, and low material usage, thus making it an ideal candidate for a circular production of electronics in general. Flexible and even stretchable electronics can be obtained with this method by printing conductive and dielectric inks on flexible/stretchable substrates opening new applications in the market. However, similar to traditional electronic production methods, current life cycle for a PE product starts with materials (substrate, conductive and dielectric materials) obtained through mining of raw materials. These materials are put into production lines, consisting of large volume analogue printing, gluing on discrete components and lamination processes. The EoL are either landfills or incineration, which in both cases, destroys precious materials, thus forcing the use of mined raw materials. The main goal of Sustain-a-Print (SaP) is to open new life-cycle routes and to design and implement sustainability into each step of the life-cycle.

We will use nanoscale chiral magnonic resonators as building blocks of artificial neural networks. The power of the networks will be demonstrated by creating magnonics versions of field programmable gate arrays, reservoir computers, and recurrent neural networks. The ultimate efficiency of the devices will be achieved by (a) maximising their magnetic nonlinearity; (b) using epitaxial yttrium iron garnet, which has the lowest known magnetic damping, for thin film magnonic media and resonators; and (c) using wireless delivery of power. Sensitive to the resonatorsâ€™ micromagnetic states, such artificial neural networks will be conveniently programmable and trainable within existing paradigms of magnetic data storage. The latter includes magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), which is already compatible with CMOS, while compatibility with other technology paradigms of spintronics will also be sought, explored, and exploited.

Work in the project is building on two existing main blocks - the CE certified robot platform PSS from project partner Preceyes, and a prototype for a Common-Path OCT system with extended measurement depth from partner ACMIT. For the AI-components to be developed, two European leading groups in this domain - ALTAIR/University of Verona and ARTORG/University of Bern - are part of the consortium.

Due to the short season, the majority of the work is conducted by foreigners with limited knowledge of the language, culture and forests. The FEROX project aims to utilize advances in AI, data, and robotics to improve the working conditions of the wild berry pickers. The project will employ autonomous drones equipped with various sensors to acquire data, build 3D models of the forests and, therefore, accurately estimate berriesâ€™ locations, amount and types. The collected data will be used to build AI models to help workers locate the berries and optimize their operations. In addition, FEROX will provide wild berry pickers with navigation and locating services and physical support to improve their working conditions and boost their trust and confidence. The holistic solution of FEROX will contribute to the overall safety of the workers by automatically monitoring the pickers and providing aid where it is needed. As a consequence, FEROX is expected to attract locals and hiking enthusiasts to work during summer in collecting wild products, hence, increasing the overall yield of the wild berries. These outcomes will open business opportunities for EU companies to adapt the solutions developed for industrialized cultivation as well as support global sustainability as technology providers for safe and sustainable berry harvesting.

To develop the next generation of fully programmable and scalable quantum computing systems based on Rydberg atoms and open them up for the European community now requires a coordinated interdisciplinary and intersectoral effort. For this, the EuRyQa consortium combines partners from academia and the private sector that are at the forefront of cold-atom technology with key industrial partners with complementary expertise on quantum hardware, classical electronics, firmware, and software. The project will bring together four Rydberg platforms with 100-1000 qubits, including three nationally funded platforms and one leading European start up, to provide a unique European solution to Rydberg-based quantum computers together with Europe-wide benchmarking and standardization of the technology.

Inefficiencies are especially evident in energy consumption.To keep up pace with the exponentially growing amount of data (e.g., video) and allow more advanced, accurate, safe and timely interactions with the surrounding environment, next-generation endpoint devices will need to run AI algorithms (e.g., computer vision) and other compute intense tasks with very low latency (i.e., units of ms or less) and energy envelops (i.e., tens of mW or less).

It would remove the uncertainty of when thinning operations are needed or where there are trees which are ready for harvest. It could also enable operators to automatically plan where their staff or equipment should be deployed. With capable (semi-)autonomous harvesting, operators eventually automating the full process. It could also better quantify a forest's carbon sequestration - with low uncertainty per-tree carbon estimates. Precise measures of crown volume and tree diameters would improve the granularity of carbon credit schemes.

Both the quantum hardware at the fundamental level, and many problems of scientific and technological relevance, are expressed in terms of multi-level systems, making this approach the most efficient choice to unlock the full potential of quantum computers and simulators.NeQST will generate foundational breakthroughs in the full value chain of qudit quantum information processing. These include qudit based firmware with scalable characterization and automatized design tools harnessing a larger Hilbert space; an end-user friendly high-level control and simulation software, enabling non-specialists to utilize the qudit hardware; the efficient simulation of quantum models of scientific relevance, such as gauge theories; the solution of optimization problems in academia and industry naturally phrased in terms of multi-level variables; and certification tools specifically designed for multi-level quantum information, enabling a device-independent validation of data. NeQST results will therefore elucidate the role of dimension in quantum physics and its use as a resource for quantum information processing.To achieve its ambitious goals, NeQST has assembled an inter-disciplinary team of leading academic and industry partners, and has developed a well-rounded work plan, as well as detailed dissemination and exploitation strategies.",2022-09-04 12:39:11,10.3030/101080086,,Digital & Emerging Technologies for Competitiveness and Fit for the Green Deal,key digital technologies including quantum technologies

In order to achieve commercial usefulness, major research efforts are now devoted to scaling up current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. The fundamental challenge to be overcome is noise, whose presence is necessitated by basic quantum and thermodynamic principles as well as limitations on the precision with which such devices can be measured and controlled. To overcome this challenge, we need to understand the fundamental thermodynamic limitations on precision in quantum devices. Remarkably, it has recently been predicted that coherent quantum processes exhibit a new kind of quantum advantage with respect to classical processes: the laws of quantum thermodynamics allow higher measurement precision for less energy and entropy cost.The ambitious goal of ASPECTS is to demonstrate, explore, and exploit this novel effect on two of the most promising quantum technology platforms: namely, superconducting qubits and nanoelectromechanical devices. Specifically, we will design and build quantum circuit devices to experimentally assess the energy cost of timekeeping and qubit readout. With support from advanced theory and numerical simulations, we will demonstrate quantum-thermodynamic precision advantage in our measurements. This ground-breaking advance will usher in a new paradigm for quantum metrology in which quantum-thermodynamic effects boost both efficiency and precision.Our balanced consortium of early-career researchers is founded on our strong existing collaborations and our unified and coherent vision for the future of energy-efficient quantum technologies.

The project focuses on knowledge graphs because of their critical role as enabler of new solutions across domains and industries in Europe. Some of the existing machine learning approaches for knowledge graphs are known to already provide guarantees with respect to their completeness and correctness. However, they are still impossible or impractical to deploy on real-world data due to the scale, incompleteness and inconsistency of knowledge graphs in the wild. We devise approaches that maintain formal guarantees pertaining to completeness and correctness while being able to exploit different representations of knowledge graphs in a concurrent fashion. With our new methods, we plan to achieve significant advances in the efficiency and scalability of machine learning, especially on knowledge graphs. A supplementary innovation of ENEXA lies in its approach to explainability. Here, we focus on devising human-centred explainability techniques based on the concept of co-construction, where human and machine enter a conversation to jointly produce human-understandable explanations.

To avoid a conflict between sustainability and economic competitiveness and to allow the European economy to leverage AI for its leadership in a climate friendly way, new technologies to reduce the energy requirements of all parts of AI system are needed. A key problem is the fact that tools (e.g. PyTorch) and methods that currently drive the rapid spread and democratization of AI prioritize performance and functionality while paying little attention to the CO2 footprint. As a consequence, we see rapid growth in AI applications, but not much so in AI applications that are optimized for low power and sustainability. To change that we aim to develop an interactive design framework and associated models, methods and tools that will foster energy efficiency throughout the whole life-cycle of ML applications: from the design and exploration phase that includes exploratory iterations of training, testing and optimizing different system versions through the final training of the production systems (which often involves huge amounts of data, computation and epochs) and (where appropriate) continuous online re-training during deployment for the inference process. The framework will optimize the ML solutions based on the application tasks, across levels from hardware to model architecture. AI developers from all experience levels will be able to make use of the framework through its emphasis on human-centric interactive transparent design and functional knowledge cores, instead of the common blackbox and fully automated optimization approaches in AutoML.

However, the models that NLP-based systems are based on are biased. Additionally, it has been shown that bias in an underlying AI model is reproduced in applications based on that model). This can lead to biased decisions that run contrary to the goals of the European Pillar of Social Rights in relationship to work and employment, specifically Pillar 2 (Gender Equality), Pillar 3 (Equal Opportunity), Pillar 5 (Secure and Adaptable Employment) and the United Nationsâ€™ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). It is therefore necessary to identify and mitigate biases that occur in applications used in a Human Resources Management (HRM) context. Addressing such concerns in an employment context is especially relevant, as most existing European studies on employment discrimination have indeed found that discrimination exists, both when considering individual diversity criteria and multiple criteria in intersectional analyses. In order to investigate and mitigate these biases, we apply this â€œBIASâ€-project, for mitigating diversity biases of AI in the labor market. The chief technical objective of BIAS is the development of a proof-of-concept for an innovative technology based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR) for use in an HR recruitment use case.",2022-08-23 20:41:08,10.3030/101070468,"Tackling gender, race and other biases in AI (RIA)",A Human-Centred and Ethical Development of Digital and Industrial Technologies,"artificial intelligence,advanced computing and big data"

However, hybrid AI does not fully address the issue of trust (validity, explainability, and ethics). ULTIMATE will pioneer the development of industrial-grade hybrid AI based on three stages to ensure trustworthiness, relying on interdisciplinary data sources and adhering to physical constraints (1st stage), as well as the development of tools for explaining, evaluating and validating hybrid AI algorithms and asserting their adherence to ethical and legal regulations (2nd stage). These will be exemplified using real-world industrial use cases (3rd stage) in the Robotics (collaboration between human and robots for logistics activities) and Space domains (Failure detection for satellites) to promote the widespread adoption of hybrid AI in industry.The breakthrough generic hybrid AI architectures with improved explainability and interpretability and the predictive model on trustworthiness developed in ULTIMATE will provide industrials with improved shopfloor efficiency (reduction of downtime by 30% and of operational costs) and empower their staff through trustful human/machine cooperation allowing highly skilled jobs and increasing decision power and safety. This will be beneficial to European industry to gain pre-emptive advantage in the market of industrial AI solutions and will eventually increase trustworthiness in the use of hybrid AI components by the wider public.Extending over 36 months, the ULTIMATE project brings together key industrial stakeholders, with relevant end-users from manufacturing sectors, leading academic and research institutions, and SMEs to collaboratively investigate and lead the development of hybrid AI approaches.",2022-09-08 12:54:21,10.3030/101070162,"Verifiable robustness, energy efficiency and transparency for Trustworthy AI: Scientific excellence boosting industrial competitiveness (AI, Data and Robotics Partnership) (RIA)",A Human-Centred and Ethical Development of Digital and Industrial Technologies,"artificial intelligence,robotics,space including earth observation"

However, current generations of XR systems fail to provide the XR experience they were envisioned for since state-of-the-art models and technologies of XR systems fail to ensure full-fledged social acceptance. A truly XR experience requires a major paradigm shift in the way XR systems are designed, implemented, deployed and consumed.

On the one hand, CV/ML are driving the extended reality (XR) revolution beyond what was possible up to now, and, on the other, speech-based interfaces and text-based content understanding are revolutionising human-machine and human-human interaction. VOXReality will employ an economical approach to combine these two. VOXReality will pursue the integration of language- and vision-based AI models with either unidirectional or bidirectional exchanges between the two modalities. Vision systems drive both AR and VR, while language understanding adds a natural way for humans to interact with the back-ends of XR systems or create multimodal XR experiences combining vision and sound. The results of the project will be twofold: 1) a set of pretrained next-generation XR models combining, in various levels and ways, language and vision AI and enabling richer, more natural immersive experiences that are expected to boost XR adoption, and 2) a set of applications using these models to demonstrate innovations in various sectors.

As our society is facing a dramatic increase in inequalities and intersectional discrimination, we need to prevent AI systems to amplify this phenomenon but rather mitigate it. To trust these systems, domain experts and stakeholders need to trust the decisions.Fairness stands as one of the main principles of Trustworthy AI promoted at EU level. How these principles, in particular fairness, translate into technical, functional social, and lawful requirements in the AI system design is still an open question. Similarly we donâ€™t know how to test if a system is compliant with these principles and repair it in case it is not.AEQUITAS proposes the design of a controlled experimentation environment for developers and users to create controlled experiments for- assessing the bias in AI systems, e.g., identifying potential causes of bias in data, algorithms, and interpretation of results,- providing, when possible, effective methods and engineering guidelines to repair, remove, and mitigate bias,- provide fairness-by-design guidelines, methodologies, and software engineering techniques to design new bias-free systemsThe experimentation environment generates synthetic data sets with different features influencing fairness for a test in laboratories. Real use cases in health care, human resources and social disadvantaged group challenges further test the experimentation platform showcasing the effectiveness of the solution proposed. The experimentation playground will be integrated on the AI-on-demand platform to boost its uptake, but a stand-alone release will enable on-premise privacy-preserving test of AI-systems fairness.AEQUITAS relies on a strong consortium featuring AI experts, domain experts in the use case sectors as well as social scientists and associations defending rights of minorities and discriminated groups.",2022-08-16 22:52:32,10.3030/101070363,"Tackling gender, race and other biases in AI (RIA)",A Human-Centred and Ethical Development of Digital and Industrial Technologies,"artificial intelligence,advanced computing and big data"

At the other extreme, one could consider nuanced communication of the exact tradeoffs involved in AI pipeline choices and their effect on industrial and bias outcomes, post hoc. Both extremes offer little in terms of optimizing the pipeline and inflexibility in explaining the pipelineâ€™s fairness-related qualities. Seeking the middle-ground, we suggest a priori certification of fairness-related qualities in AI pipelines via modular compositions of pre-processing, training, inference, and post-processing steps with certain properties. Furthermore, we present an extensive programme in explainability of fairness-related qualities. We seek to inform both the developer and the user thoroughly in regards to the possible algorithmic choices and their expected effects.

There is a fundamental gap between Functional Safety (FUSA) requirements of CAIS and the nature of DL solutions needed to satisfy those requirements. The lack of transparency (mainly explainability and traceability), and the data-dependent and stochastic nature of DL software clash against the need for deterministic, verifiable and pass/fail test-based software solutions for CAIS.SAFEXPLAIN tackles this challenge by providing a novel and flexible approach to allow the certification â€“ hence adoption â€“ of DL-based solutions in CAIS by (1) architecting transparent DL solutions that allow explaining why they satisfy FUSA requirements, with end-to-end traceability, with specific approaches to explain whether predictions can be trusted, and with strategies to reach (and prove) correct operation, in accordance with certification standards.

Yet, by relying almost exclusively on visual and auditory feedbacks, these devices pose evident accessibility issues. Current smartphones and tablets provide accessibility features, but mostly in the form of text-to-speech, which can be impractical and affect literacy, and through connectivity to refreshable Braille displays, which involve an additional peripheral, often bulky and expensive or when small too limited.

In Europe, 25,8 million tonnes of plastic waste is generated annually and less than 30 % is collected for recycling and significant shares are exported from EU to be treated elsewhere. Landfilling (31 %) and incineration (39 %) of plastics is high (together 70 %), and by these treatment options the valuable materials are lost from circulation. It is estimated that 95 % of the value of plastic packaging material, between 70-105 billion EUR, is lost annually to the economy after a very short first-use cycle. The industry is lacking standards and main barriers for efficient uptake of recyclates are due to safety concerns, low quality, and recycling rates. PRIMUS activities will increase the resilience of EU's plastic value chains by securing supply of waste plastics as feedstock and increasing its availability through connecting value chain actors, developing methods to control quality, sampling, and analysis, and improving upgrading knowhow and characterize suitability towards added-value products. PRIMUS will prove legislative compliant, privacy-preserving, cost-efficient and feasible technological pathways for tapping into non-recycled or underutilized plastic waste streams. Validated business cases will lower the risks of future investments into European manufacturing capacity. PRIMUS will address one of the core challenges identified in the EU Circular Economy Action Plan, the presence of hazardous substances (brominated flame retardants) and how to effectively and safely debrominate the waste streams for new product use.

However, as reported in the HERA target priorities, the persistence of the emergency status requires daily actions that tackle the spread of COVID.In this economical, societal and clinical context, the project MIRIA aims to develop wide-range-antimicrobial nanocoatings to be used in hospitals and other environments where cross-contamination and contagion risk are significant issues. In the wake of the covid outbreak, there has been large concern about infection spread of pathogens (i.e., bacteria, fungi, virus, and specifically SARS-CoV-2) via high traffic surfaces (i.e., medical equipment). State of the art and commercial products coating solutions that both target a range of mixed pathogens and different surfaces (e.g., glass, metal, textile) are unfortunately scant. MIRIA solutions aim to fill this void, impacting on EU health, both directly (by creating public safe environments) and indirectly (by reducing COVID spreading and decreasing ill-related work absences and psychological pathologies). A reduction of the work absence of at least 5% with respect to the 2020 value (15M in EU) is expected.MIRIA main challenging ambition is to develop nanocoatings with a 99.99% effectiveness against a wide range of pathogens, especially SARS-CoV-2. This will be based on a four pieces puzzle: the knowledge in anti-microbial materials, nanopowders, nanocoating and pilot plant conduction.

Just recently, it was demonstrated by our team that the mineral was amenable to processing to single phase p-type tetrahedrite. Thirdly, by the production of TE energy harvesting systems offering a contribution to the reduction of fossil fuels consumption with a great impact on the increase of the overall efficiency of energy production and consumption systems, as well as on the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions. For that, START project aggregates research organizations, with strong background and knowledge on geology, materials science and renewable energies, and industrial organizations that guarantee the entire production and exploitation supply chain.",2022-09-04 12:23:02,10.3030/101058632,Building innovative value chains from raw materials to sustainable products (IA),"Increased Autonomy in Key Strategic Value Chains for

To address this problem the MC4 project aims at establishing a multi-level circular process for carbon and glass fibre composite. Multi-level means that processes will be developed for short-term implementation with immediate impact and for the longer term with a wider impact on industry. Carbon and glass fibre have substantially different costs and the project takes this into account by developing economically feasible procedures that are based on chemical matrix/fibre separation for carbon fibre and on a new type of resing for the direct re-use of the composite for glass fibre. Quality grading of the recycled material will be a key element to ensure a proper use in the different domains. Within the supply chain investigated in the project the goal is to achieve a recycling rate of at least 60%.As an additional benefit, the project will enable European material manufacturers to develop their own, patented processes for manufacturing of recycled material. Currently, 80% of the manufacturing of virgin carbon and glass fibre is taking place outside of Europe and the manufacturing technologies used inside of Europe are often licensed from foreign countries.MC4 puts particular emphasis on the design and manufacturing of best practice examples of parts made from recycled materials.

CAN will provide the thermosetting epoxy resin with the ability to respond to certain stimulus that changes the state of its microstructure and thus, the ability to be reprocessed/re-polymerized (return to original monomers and fibres). A similar strategy will be applied to existing fossil-based epoxy formulations. In this way, the thermoset can be reprocessed or re-polymerized into new products and the fibres can be recovered as well. In addition, fibres of renewable origin will be used as reinforcement to manufacturing thermoset composites.

However, Europe depends 100% on REEs imports and there are no market-ready substitutes. Despite the fact that significant amounts of EoL products containing REE-based PMs are collected in Europe, the current recycling processes do not allow PMs recovery, and therefore they are lost downstream. To face this challenge, the REEPRODUCE project aims at setting up, for the first time, a resilient and complete European REEs-recycling value chain, at industrial scale for the recovery of REEs at competitive cost compared to REEs primary production in China (at least 25% cheaper) with environmentally friendly  and socially sustainable technologies. REEPRODUCE will capitalize on the knowledge generated in previous projects and aim to solve all remaining technical challenges along the value chain to construct pilots able to produce 70 t of PMs per year from variety of EoL products bearing Nd-based PMs. Additionally it will demonstrate the conversion of PMs extracted from many different EoL products into high purity Rare Earth Elements Oxide (REO)-mixtures and Rare Earth Elements Alloy (REA) that will be used in the manufacturing of new PMs with performances similar to those manufactured with virgin REEs-intensive materials.

Firstly, AMBHER is addressing the main societal, economic and technological questions coming together with the use of green ammonia as seasonal renewable energy storage. Simultaneously, AMBHER is developing and demonstrating innovative and cheaper compressed hydrogen storage potentially solving the gap toward local and economically relevant power-to-hydrogen hub. AMBHER will thus increase the number of applications in the energy and transport sectors and the possibilities for success and industrial adoption by key players. For short-term hydrogen storage, novel nanoporous MOFs (Metal Organic Frameworks) of high surface area (>2.500 m2/g) and low cost synthesis will be developed following an original shaping process (3D printing). Furthermore, AMBHER will develop a conformable cryo-vessel that can accommodate stacks of MOF bodies of tailored-made shape. A capacity of 40g/L of usable space at 100 bar is achieved at competitive cost with respect to current high pressure cylinders (600-1.000 euros/kg H2). For long-term storage, advanced materials (both catalysts and membranes) and their combination in an intensified 3D-printed intensified periodic open cell structured reactor will be developed to allow hydrogen storage in the form of ammonia (NH3) in a cost-efficient and resource-effective process at lower temperatures and pressures compared to conventional systems.

The storage and transport of hydrogen, however, faces important challenges which hinder its broad application as an alternative and zero emission fuel. Storage of hydrogen as a gas typically requires high-pressure tanks (up to 700 bar tank pressure); storage of hydrogen as a liquid requires cryogenic temperatures because the boiling point of hydrogen at one atmosphere pressure is -253C. Therefore, for several applications, ammonia rises as a rather prominent vector if it can be produced efficiently. The production is traditionally bound by the constraints of thermodynamics, which require high synthesis pressures, as well as temperatures. Thus, NH3 is produced centralised/large-scaled. HySTrAm builds on developing physical H2 storage materials, enabling short term storage (buffering renewables dynamics), as well as the 3 structural corner stones of flexible low pressure NH3: decreased Ru content catalysts, high temperature NH3 sorbents and induction-heated support granting (optimal) responsiveness.

The corresponding process will comprise two steps: a first one for CO2 and H2S reduction into COS and a second step for COS decomposition into the platform molecule CO and Claus grade sulphur. To demonstrate its valorisation potential, CO will be converted into green methanol as final product using a third reaction. The e-CODUCT consortium is composed of nine entities including industrial and academic partners spanning a complete value chain from material suppliers and engineers to modelling experts and technology providers. e-CODUCT will optimise and scale-up the reactor materials and catalysts to TRL6 to 16t/y of CO production while reducing reactor size by 50%, among others via the removal of heating units. Techno-economic and environmental assessment of the reactor performances will demonstrate -40% CAPEX and OPEX as well as -50% of GHG emissions. Optimisation of operating conditions and reaction yield will be supported by fundamental (micro)kinetic modelling as well as industrial process planning accounting for variability of feedstock composition and renewable energy resources. Integrated conceptual design will fasten future scale-up and commercialisation of the reactor demonstrator at TRL9 with a final capacity of 34kt of CO2 converted per year. e-CODUCT will provide a first-of-a-kind fast-response electrically heated catalytic reactor able to replace the conventional Claus unit for sulphur recovery and simultaneous electroreduction of CO2, allowing -50% energy demand for acid gas treatment in over 130 refineries in Europe by 2035.

The project directly connects to the EU Strategy for the Danube Region (EUSDR), a macro-regional strategy to address common economic and societal challenges and create synergies and coordination between existing policies and initiatives. Danube neighbouring states share a proud and centuries-old history of manufacturing and industrial production, yet political upheavals, globalisation and technological advancements have confronted many Danube regions with the challenges of structural transformation and have triggered the closing down of numerous industrial plants and sites. In many regions, plant closures and the associated displacement of workers caused severe socio-economic effects on workers, local communities and regions. At the heart of the RIS4Danu project is the goal of applying an evidence-based Smart Specialisation (S3) approach to support place-based innovation for green/digital and inclusive transitions in regions along the Danube River. This project ties in with current debates and requests to combine smart specialisation with considerations of socio-ecological challenges such as climate change, environmental issues and growing social and territorial inequality: Smart Specialisation Strategies for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth (S4+). We argue that the re-opening of old industrial sites shows the potential to build transformative resilience in less-favoured Danube regions. These sites could serve as innovation anchors, unleashing opportunities for the entire region to strengthen their capacity to develop innovative solutions to place-specific ecological, social and economic challenges.

One of the main goals of the Strategy is to ?ensure that by 2025 10 million tonnes of recycled plastics find their way into new products on the EU market? , against less than 4 million tonnes in 2016. However, in 2016 only 8.4 million tonnes of plastics went to recycling facilities as input material. For this reason, the collection rate has to improve significantly and more collected material needs to reach recycling facilities instead of being incinerated or landfilled. Additionally, the demand for recycled plastics needs a boost, especially in added value applications where the current share is still zero or very low. Another precondition for the uptake of recycled plastics in added value products is trust. On the supply side, definitions, standards and traceability will help OEMs integrating recycled plastics into their business models.

This allows achieving an energy efficiency close to 95%, i.e., nearly twice the value typical for gas-fired heat boxes, and a reactor volume that is two orders-of-magnitude smaller. As designed, the 250 kW reactor integrated with all required peripherals in a reforming skid will be used to produce approximately 400 kg/day of 99.999% pure H2. This is equivalent to the size of a commercially relevant biogas reforming plant for the decentralized production of renewable H2.

Today, lack of support for sharing data in a secure, quality assured, and automated way is one of the main obstacles that industry actors point to when creating new circular value networks. Together with using different terminologies and not having explicit definitions of the concepts that appear in data, this makes it very difficult to create new ecosystems of actors in Europe today. This project will address the core challenges of making decentralized data and information understandable and usable for humans as well as machines. The project will leverage open standards for semantic data interoperability in establishing a shared vocabulary (ontology network) for data documentation, as well as a decentralized digital platform that enables collaboration in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The project addresses a number of open research problems, including the development of ontologies that need to model a wide range of different materials and products, not only providing vertical interoperability but also horizontal interoperability, for cross-industry value networks. As well as transdisciplinary research on methods to find, analyse and assess new circular value chain configurations opened up by considering resource, information, value and energy flows as an integral part of the same complex system. Three industry use cases, from radically different industry domains, act as drivers for the research and development activities, as well as test beds and demonstrators for the cross-industry applicability of the results. The developed solutions will allow for automation of planning, management, and execution of circular value networks, at a European scale, and beyond.

The project aims at developing a truly new Surface Acoustic Wave(SAW) filter technology not yet available to space industry. This innovation based on Piezo-On-Insulator (POI) wafers already produced for Smart phone industry is not accessible to space industry due to market size and its own high reliability specificities. Compared to existing technologies, POI-based SAW filters enable high integration, temperature stability, thermal management, low insertion loss and high rejection with various bandwidths in L- and S-band frequencies, replacing leaky waves on usual piezoelectric substrates by real guided waves on Silicon-based wafers. This project will deliver, as first pillar, POI-based SAW filters for space industry up to a TRL7 addressing all volume demands, in line with Geosynchronous Earth Orbiting satellites to Low Earth Orbiting satellite constellations. The supply chain for key items such as POI wafer supply, to front-end and back-end process is based in Europe. The high demand of innovation yielding reduced mass in satellites especially for new growing markets within a limited access time, has pushed to develop in HOMEMADE a second pillar that will deliver disruptive POI based SAW filters able to compete with bulky mechanical filters.

This solution will differentiate from other developments tightly linked to a specific launch site, safety regulation and oriented (cost and mass) to institutional launchers. The proposed AFTU segregates the general-purpose sensors and functions (e.g. localisation) from the mission abort rules which are launcher and spaceport dependant, allowing customisation for a given launcher and site.

Without an efficient EPS, many of the capabilities that we take today for granted, such as high-speed communications, GNSS and science payloads, would not be possible.Power transistors are key elements of the electrical units that form the EPS and other systems, since they allow the most efficient (in terms of power and mass) electrical power processing topologies. During the last decade, several technological advancements have enabled a new type of transistors based on Gallium Nitride over Silicon. GaN transistors allow a reduction in mass of the equipment that uses them and a reduction in power consumption.Currently, Europe does not have the capabilities to produce GaN transistors for space unless relying on external countries for most of the supply chain, which is something that cannot be taken for granted. The objective of the SAGAN proposal is to overcome this situation by establishing a non-dependent supply chain (design, manufacturing, processing, and qualification testing) for GaN transistors that are suitable for space applications. The transistors will be tested to assess radiation effects, thermal dynamics, structural behaviour, reliaability... To achieve it, a strong consortium has been established.

First of all, the computational power of the hardware platform must meet the needs of the advanced algorithms running on top of it. The software layer too must both allow an efficient use of the hardware resources and at the same time guarantee non-functional properties such as dependability in compliance with ECSS standards. Finally, the design methods need to adapt to the specific challenges posed by both the increased complexity of the hardware/software layers and the Industry 4.0 concepts.The METASAT vision is that a design methodology based on Model-Based engineering jointly with the use of open architecture hardware constitutes that solid ground. To reach its vision, METASAT will leverage existing software virtualisation layers (e.g., hypervisors), that already provide guarantees in terms of standards compliance, on top of high-performance computing platforms based on open hardware architectures. The focus of the project will be on the development of a toolchain to design software modules for this hardware/software layer.

In the same year, 29.1mio tons of plastic waste was generated in the EU and only a third was recycled. While sorted and pure plastic waste can be recycled relatively well, a major problem is recycling of unsorted waste, which still holds a large share of valuable carbon feedstock but is currently either landfilled or energetically valorised, i.e., incinerated, both producing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions instead of recovering the precious carbon feedstock contained. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop new technologies that can not only valorise unsorted plastic but also other waste in large amounts to yield material streams that can replace fossil material streams. One promising technology to recycle unsorted heterogeneous plastic waste is pyrolysis. While the low to medium temperature pyrolysis (400C) produces mainly liquid oil that needs to be fed into the furnace of the steam cracker unit (at higher temperature than 900C) to produce olefins, with our proposal, at high-temperature pyrolysis (<850C) syngas stream (light olefins rich) is fostered and could be integrated downstream the furnace of the steam cracker. However, the use of high-temperature pyrolysis for plastic waste recycling has not yet become an industrial practice since gas treatment and integration present a great challenge. Plastics2Olefins project will address this challenge - it will design, build, and run a demonstration plant for recycling of unsorted plastic waste at Repsol's plant Puertollano (Spain), which will be digitalised and run on 100% renewable (electric) energy.The project estimates to reduce the lifecycle GHG emissions by 70-80% compared to incineration and existing plastics recycling processes providing an important contribution to the EU reaching climate neutral by 2050 and set a pathway for commercialisation of renewable plastic feedstock replacing fossil fuels.",2022-08-26 15:30:03,10.3030/101058032,Plastic waste as a circular carbon feedstock for industry (Processes4Planet Partnership) (IA),"Climate Neutral, Circular and Digitised Production","circular industries,low carbon and clean industries"

Natural gas driven DR is established in industry mostly outside Europe but there are no experiences with high H2 enrichment > 80%. H2 based reduction is no principal issue but endothermic and the influences on morphology, diffusion and effective kinetics are not known. Also properties and movement of particles in the reactor are not know and issues like sticking cannot be excluded. Probably, temperature distribution and flow of solids and gas will be clearly different. No reliable prognosis is possible yet, in particular with regard to local permeability, process stability and product quality of industrial size furnaces with higher loads on the particles and larger local differences. Many activities are initiated for first industrial demonstration of H2-enriched DR but they will not close many of these knowledge gaps. MaxH2DR provides missing knowledge and data of reduction processes. A world-first test rig determines pellet properties at conditions of industrial H2 enriched DR furnaces and a physical demonstrator shows the linked solid and gas flow in shaft furnaces. This will be combined with digitals models including the key technology DEM-CFD to provide a hybrid demonstrator able to investigate scale-up and to optimise DR furnace design and operating point. This sound basis will be used to optimise the process integration into existing process chains. Simulation tools will be combined to a toolkits that covers impacts of product properties on downstream processes as well as impacts on gas and energy cycles.

However, they come with significant data management challenges. According to IDC, the total amount of data generated only by connected devices will exceed 40 trillion gigabytes by 2025. In most of the current systems, data storage and analysis happen on centralized locations on the cloud. This is pushing network capacity to its limits. Furthermore, centralized storage and processing lead to single point of failure situations, which are critically inefficient in case of disasters and crisis. Our world is continuously living natural disasters, health crisis, climate change and security threats that show the importance of resilient and energy-efficient information systems. COGNIFOG targets those challenges and proposes to build a Cognitive Fog Framework to: (i) reduce energy consumption and latency in next generation IT systems by reducing the network traffic, by analysing data at the edge in a distributed manner, closer to where they are generated, rather than routing them through the communication networks to a data center; (ii) reduce OPEX and faster service provisioning by providing a cognitive, self-adaptive framework with minimum or no human intervention, with dynamic provisioning of computing, storage and networking resources along the far-edge-to-edge-to-cloud path; (iii) ensure European leadership by providing an open interoperable framework with open APIs for application developers to rapidly create and deploy applications benefiting the edge-cloud continuum on top of heterogenous IoT/IT systems.

Modern cloud applications have also become more complex as they usually run on a distributed computer system, split up into components that must run with high availability. Unifying such diverse systems into centrally controlled compute clusters and providing sophisticated scheduling decisions across them are two major challenges in this field. Scheduling decisions for a cluster consisting of cloud and edge nodes must consider unique characteristics such as variability in node and network capacity. The common solution for orchestrating large clusters is Kubernetes, however, it is designed for reliable homogeneous clusters. Many applications and extensions are available for Kubernetes. Unfortunately, none of them accounts for optimization of both performance and energy or addresses data and job locality.In DECICE, we develop an open and portable cloud management framework for automatic and adaptive optimization of applications by mapping jobs to the most suitable resources in a heterogeneous system landscape.

To help to materialize the European bid on a true continuum in the next few years, CloudSkin pursues to build a cognitive cloud continuum platform with three main innovations: 1. The CloudSkin platform will leverage AI/ML to optimize workloads, resources, energy, and network traffic for a rapid adaptation to changes in application behavior and data variability, re-configuraing the """"sweet spot"""" between the cloud and the edge in the face of the rapid varying conditions;2. The CloudSkin platform will also help users to achieve â€œstack identicalityâ€ across the Cloud-edge continuum, whereby the same (legacy) software stacks (e.g., MPI programs) running in data centers can seamlessly run at remote edges. The development of a new lightweight, portable virtualizaion abstraction will be paired with the development of new confidential abstractions to protect data while it is in use; and 3. CloudSkin will also contribute to prepare the needed infrastructure to integrate the new virtualized execution abstractions into the virtual resource continuum, particularly, for those Cloud-edge applications composed of small tasks with fast data access and sharing requirements.

Moreover, the AC3 platform can adapt to a different context and events happening in the network, such as lack of resources, data deluge, or mobility of data source, by managing (i.e., deploying or migrating) micro-services across CECC infrastructures.

MIS has several advantages (reduced tissue damage, postoperative analgesic requirements & blood loss, decreased hospitalization time, better cosmetic results), but there is limited or none visual, haptic, and tactile feedback in-situ, along with issues of tool dexterity. These issues can lead to accidental tissue damage. The probe (diam. 5mm, length 15-20mm) incorporates multiple sensing modalities and a thin, flexible, pneumatically actuated end-effector (3DOF, 180deg) with distributed sensors for distributed tactile sensing. The probe consists of the photonic sensing elements and a sphere held at the end of a circular tunnel by a steady flow of air. The sphere is free to rotate in all directions and can move into the channel when pressed against the airflow. When rolling over tissue, the displacement depends on the tissueâ€™s stiffness and is picked up by the optical fibre above it. Optical intensity variation in the sensing element is used to identify tissue stiffness variations. The principle of measurement used is extrinsic light intensity modulation provided through optical fibres. A non-planar photonics circuit (200Î¼m waveguide, 8bit colour depth) for haptic sensor array is developed and interfaced with the probe; this circuit will be engraved on ultra-thin polymeric foil. The foil sensing elements are distributed around & along the probe for multiple sensor inputs for palpation (i.e., stiffness), distance and curvature that are then fused to provide the overall tissue situation. Using thin foils allows for ease of integration with the probe and a straightforward manufacturing process to enable low cost in large volumes.

We argue that future research cannot focus on incremental or separate steps in drone design and autonomy alone.

The challenge in PK management is that this kind of knowledge may be hard to explain and describe, oftentimes it is poorly digitalised, and, even when documented, it may be still difficult to access and retrieve by industry operators. The PERKS project supports the holistic governance of industrial PK in its entire life cycle, from elicitation to management and from access to exploitation. PERKS bases its solutions on AI (both symbolic and subsymbolic) and data technologies, by advancing and integrating existing methodologies and tools in terms of readiness, flexibility and user acceptance.

Soft lower extremity exoskeletons (â€œsoft wearable robotics"""" (SWRs)) are one of the most challenging research topics, and require multidisciplinary approaches involving diverse fields such as neuroscience, biomechanics, robot control, ergonomics and other fields.SWAG aims to explore a fundamentally new approach to engineering soft structures that omit fully rigid materials for inflatable ones made from high-strength fabrics and films when manufacturing human-assistive exoskeletal devices that target strain-prone segments of the human body (i.e. lower body and core). Such soft wearable adaptive garments with actuation capabilities offer higher variable stiffness and force-to-weight ratios compared to other existing methods, and simultaneously entirely conform to each jointâ€™s intricate kinematics. Because of this, new design approaches can be used as building blocks to realise complete assistance for multi-degree-of-freedom joints, such as the ankle or hip, by adapting flexible and conforming motions achieved by continuum robot designs. SWAGâ€™s advances will be demonstrated in 4 different application scenarios. The project brings together 13 partners from 5 EU countries and the UK.

However, there is a lack of tools for real-time activity analysis of disease-related protease biomarkers. To address this issue, we propose to develop a highly sensitive graphene-based biosensor platform for parallel detection of multiple proteases in serum. We will exploit a new label-free sensing mechanism based on charge removal due to cleavage of designer peptides by proteases. As a specific business case, we plan to address therapy response prediction along treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD is one of the most common and burdensome mental disorders worldwide. MDD is also among the most expensive brain diseases in Europe. While effective treatments exist, there is a high variability in treatment response. There are no serum-based tests to predict personalized therapy for MDD patients. The effective treatment is identified through trial and error, a great burden for patients and the health care system. A rapid, sensitive and easy-to-use test would allow faster and more precise treatment identification, improving therapy outcomes and reducing hospitalization times. Here, we plan to detect two protease biomarkers associated with MDD. The biosensors will be validated in clinical serum samples. Arrays of graphene biosensors will be integrated on silicon wafers with a multiplexed readout matrix to realize a miniaturized sensor system with multi-analyte detection capability, high dynamic range, high precision, low detection limit, and low material consumption. The resulting platform technology may enable various point-of-care diagnostic and therapy prediction tools.

The MAGICIAN project will take on the challenge producing a modular automation solution in which robots are used to detect and rework production defects before the last production phases commence and the aesthetics of the product is finalised. The project will produce two robotic solutions, one for defect analysis (the SR) and one for the defectsâ€™ rework (the CR). The SR and the CR can be used separately, with the humans remaining in charge of some of the activities, or in combination, with the CR operating on the defects identified by the SR. The SR can also be used in connection with the welding robotic station in order to adapt the process parameters.  The robots will use Artificial Intelligence modules to detect and discriminate the defects from multi-modal data (the SR) or to decide the best policy to use for defect rework (the CR). In both cases, the decision logic of the modules will be trained using machine learning algorithms. The training data set will be acquired with the help of workers, who will operate on semi-worked products within a controlled environment. The SR and the CR will rely on the software services of a common robotic platform.

These advanced AI paradigms are ideal for exploiting true Human-AI collaboration since, in each of them, the worker is the key actor with complete control and understanding of the performed operations. AL enables the development of effective Human-in-the-Loop systems that involve humans when AI faces increased uncertainty. Neuro-Symbolic Learning combines DL with semantics and rules to complete highly complex tasks with high accuracy while requiring considerably less training data than current AI models. Advanced XAI models will be made available, providing explanations of modelsâ€™ predictions while considering the global context instead of just analysing the feature importance of a single AI model. HumAIneâ€™s XAI will provide guidance to humans to  enable the timely optimisation of AL and SL models where human participants provide feedback dynamically as well as fine-tuning of Neuro-Symbolic models. The platform will handle various types of structured and unstructured data, including inputs from humans that will be semantically correlated through ontologies, knowledge graphs, and semantic interoperability. HumAIne will complement its platform with complementary resources (e.g., training) and will be build a vibrant community of interested parties around it, to drive exploitation and wider use of the project's results.",2023-09-19 15:56:40,10.3030/101120218,"AI for human empowerment (AI, Data and Robotics Partnership) (RIA)",A Human-Centred and Ethical Development of Digital and Industrial Technologies,"artificial intelligence,advanced computing and big data,extended reality"

Examples include routing problems, which involve a sequence of steps from source to destination; the control of manufacturing processes, which consist of a variable sequence of operations; or active learning problems, in which machine learning algorithms query human users for a sequence of inputs.We address the compelling scientific and technological goal of tackling users' lack of trust in AI, which currently often hinders the acceptance of AI systems. We break down this problem into two complementary aspects. First, users do not understand current AI systems well, with a lack of transparency leading to misinterpretations and mistrust. Second, current AI systems do not understand users well, offering solutions that are inadequately tailored to the users' needs and preferences.PEER will focus on how to systematically put the user at the centre of the entire AI design, development, deployment, and evaluation pipeline, allowing for truly mixed human-AI initiatives on complex sequential decision-making problems.

All membrane systems will unlock greater energy efficiency and decreased emissions in their respective sectors. High separation performances together with increased chemical, mechanical and thermal stability will be demonstrated. Moreover, re-usage and recycling of membranes will be validated. Beyond these demonstrations, the project will generate novel insights on membrane separation including a variety of flexible solutions to help industry, the scientific community and policy makers accelerate the rollout of separation technologies. To maximise the impact of CUMERI, other promising separations will be screened and the transferability of results to other industries (refinery, pharmaceuticals, etc.) will be ensured.Through its activities, CUMERI will pave the way to decreased emissions in the industry, to the greater valorisation of valuable chemicals, and to more energy-efficient processes, promoting resilient and circular industrial value chains.",2022-11-25 10:10:08,10.3030/101091812,Membranes for gas separations - membrane distillation (IA),"Increased Autonomy in Key Strategic Value Chains for

Thermal Spray technologies for the deposition of Hardmetals were developed for this reason, i.e., specifically to provide higher resistance to sliding and abrasive wear, coupled with good corrosion resistance. In this field innovation is based on experimental trial-and-error and operational feedback, because the equations that can model the coating performance have to consider the mechanical properties of the hard phase and those of the metal binder, their microstructure and interaction, and their evolution during the non-equilibrium Thermal Spray process. The final coating properties depend on all these factors and more, and they are too many for a physical modelling workflow to provide reliable results on a time scale that is compliant with industrial responses to fluctuating markets, supply chains and regulations. On the other hand, tools based on experimental data that rely only on final coating macro properties require extensive datasets to be reliable. This again conflicts with the response time required by industrial innovation. Moreover, innovation in coating technology is not just a matter of performance and costs: industrial companies have to consider multiple other factors such as the impact on workers, hidden regulatory costs, environmental protection costs, and also general public opinion. CoBRAIN offers a solution to this need, exploiting the integration of computational and experimental data through semantic interoperability, and developing an intelligent tool that will be able to propose novel materials from the class of High Entropy Hardmetals for direct deposition by HVOF, HVAF and CGS Thermal Spray, and capable to estimate their impact on the economy and the environment.",2022-11-25 10:08:54,10.3030/101092211,Advanced materials modelling and characterisation (RIA),"Increased Autonomy in Key Strategic Value Chains for

Indeed, while nc-Si is widely used in MEMS production, the dynamics of such an optically and electrically active nanocrystalline material has barely been investigated, leaving fundamental gaps in the understanding of the interplay between electrons, phoTons and phoNons.In this context, we propose an up-scalable, cost efficient, room temperature and Si-compatible nano-opto-electro-mechanical platform for powering efficient communications technologies.

As a result, the industry has recognised the need for transformative technologies and production methods to develop lighter, more efficient, and cost-effective solutions to enable this transition and achieve climate neutrality.With their outstanding mechanical strength, Carbon Fibre Composites (CFC) have been increasingly used to replace metals in products requiring lightweight features, such as aircraft or high-performance vehicles.

Thus far, only five peptide-analogues have been converted to oral formulations such as tablets/capsules and all face distinct challenges including low bioavailability, dosage control, patient administration inconvenience and restrictions in use (e.g. undesirable food interactions). The BUCCAL-PEP consortium will join hands to develop a multifunctional biomaterial patch which allows, for the first time, buccal (in the cheek) delivery of peptide-analogue therapies, thereby overcoming these challenges through unique integration of a permeation enhancer (SDC) with biomaterials and a peptide-analogue. The novel formulation enables peptides to diffuse across the mucosal multilayer, thereby effectively achieving their intended pharmacological response. The novel approach will result in an improved quality of patient life and increased treatment compliance. Within this project, the consortium will design, select and manufacture a lead product (with Type 2 Diabetes as showcase indication) that will be validated for performance in in vivo large animal studies. Additionally, a Health Technology Assessment will be performed to support the development an evidence-based value proposition and aid in the development of a commercialisation strategy. The final deliverable of the project is a patch that is pre-clinically validated and ready for clinical trials in the desired showcase indication. Overall, the BUCCAL-PEP project will provide a platform technology for oromucosal delivery of peptide-analogues that will be suitable for a broad range of experimental- and approved peptides-analogues therapies across a multitude of disease indications.

MI is the endpoint of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). In Europe, the highest rates of IHD worldwide equal ~26.5 million patients. Standards of care interventions after MI have serious limitations in treatment efficacy (many patients are still at risk of developing heart failure) and patient safety. There is a clear medical need for new treatment solutions that prevent scar tissue formation and irreversible cardiac remodelling. Our robust preclinical dataset so far indicates that the ELR hydrogel has this promising functionality via multiple unique characteristics: it provides selective cell adhesion to the endocardium, providing a barrier to scar tissue formation; it offers high biospecificity to the ischaemic microenvironment, and it has an enhanced biodegradability, allowing for safe disintegration in the body. To facilitate endocardial delivery of the ELR hydrogel, we will develop a minimally invasive endocardial catheter in this project. Both components (hydrogel + catheter) will be advanced to the preparedness level for a first-in-human (FIH) validation study for the application as therapeutic intervention post-MI (to be performed after the project).

The vast majority of sensors receive analog inputs from the real world and generate analog signals to be processed. However, digitizing these signals not only creates enormous amount of raw data but also require a lot of memory and high-power consumption. As the number of sensor-based IoTs grows, bandwidth limitations make it difficult to send everything back to a cloud rapidly enough for real-time processing and decision-making, especially for delay-sensitive applications such as driverless vehicles, robotics, or industrial manufacturing. In this context, PHASTRAC proposes to develop a novel analog-to-information neuromorphic computing paradigm based on oscillatory neural networks (ONNs).

Several exploration missions are planned in the near future, in particular to the Moon. One major environmental constraint during those missions is the presence of charged dust-like particles, as they can degrade equipment by accelerating wear. Moreover, exposure to and inhalation of dust can have a range of toxic effects on human explorers. There is a recognised need for developing efficient dust mitigation systems. To develop such systems, (i) better knowledge and models of dust charging and transportation in those environments are needed, and (ii) technologies to move charged dust particles in a controlled way must be validated. The objective of the DUSTER project is to develop an instrument for in situ analysis of dust-like particles and their transport in the context of planetary and small body exploration missions. This instrument will be designed to measure for which set of parameters (electrostatic charging of particles, ambient plasma, imposed electric field) dust-like particles can be moved. The technology developed can serve as a basis to design electrostatic dust mitigation devices and dust sample-collecting equipment. The above-mentioned parameters will be determined theoretically and supported by laboratory-based measurements for particles with different properties and under different conditions. Following the requirements derived from the simulations and laboratory measurements, the individual sub-units and units of the proposed instrument will be designed. An integrated breadboard version of the instrument will be manufactured and tested with the same laboratory setup. The target is to reach TRL 4.

However, given that these missions would require significant burn time of the EPS, several important issues must be addressed that go beyond the simple ability of manufacturing larger EPS components. Specifically, qualifying such electric thrusters for lifetime is currently a showstopper.In the race to the Moon and Mars, as well as other lucrative commercial missions within earthâ€™s orbit beyond 2030, the European Space industry must catch up with the US. Studies within Europe have already been initiated for the incremental development of 20-kW class Hall thrusters such as the FP7 HiPER project which produced the PPSÂ®20k ML thruster up to TRL4, FP7 CHEOPS project which permitted SITAEL to develop their 20kW HET, ESA projects allowing UNIPI to develop their nested multi-channel TANDEM thruster or the ongoing H2020 ASPIRE project led by SITAEL.

H2GLASS will address the challenges related to NOx emissions and high flame propagation speed, process efficiency, and supply of H2 for on-site demonstrations. Digital Twin techniques will be critical for risk-based predictive maintenance, optimized production control, and combustion system control. Hydrogen will be supplied by a portable electrolyser co-funded by the industrial demonstrators, and the oxygen produced will be reused in the process. The H2GLASS technologies and design solutions will be validated up to TRL 7 on 5 industrial demonstrators from 3 segments (container glass, flat glass and glass fibre), which together represent 98% of the current glass production in the EU. The expertise of partners such as Steklarna Hrastnik, PTML Pilkington, Owens Corning and Stara Glass representing the State Of The Art (SOTA) in the use of H2 in the glass process will be an asset for the H2GLASS Consortium.

This is achieved through novel sensor combinations and analysis supported by artificial intelligence. A key part is the connection between scrap sorter and the steel industry which are the consumers of the scrap. This ensures that there is a demand for the enhanced purification and valorisation methods. The steel industry also enables the industrial scale verification of the PURESCRAP methods, where sorted scrap is used for steelmaking in semi-industrial and industrial scale.The shredding process is identified as the most promising method leading to impurity liberation and later removal, for which the site of the Swedish scrap supplier STENA is chosen for demonstration. With a better analysis of the scrap material after the sorting and preparation chain, appropriate material handling can be optimised for desired outputs. During the project, sensor stations will be integrated in the two separate processing chains for heavy (cut) and shredded scrap. The proposed innovation of PURESCRAP has the ambition to go far beyond industrial state-of-the-art to achieve a higher recycling rate of post-consumer scrap (increased share of low-quality scrap over the total scrap input by at least 40% or more) compared to the usual practice for a specific steel quality, whereas realistic grades are e.g., rail steel R260 (1.0623; EN13674) and engineering steel 42CrMo4 (1.7225; DIN EN10083).

The recent COVID-19 pandemic is causing manufacturers to rethink and reassess their global supply chains and the flexibility of their production sites. Resilience means the ability to withstand difficult situations, while flexibility can be considered as the ability to accommodate changes without incurring significant extra costs. Production processes demanding high human skill such as forming processes, requires readjustment of the process parameters of all production steps as a new product evolves. The deficiencies can be attributed largely to the lack of efficient ways for trusted data sharing among the stakeholders without interoperability barriers. There is a need to be able to determine when such changes lead to deterministic-chaotic behavior with far reaching consequences.FLEX4RES provides an open platform to support production networks' reconfiguration for resilient manufacturing value chains.

While some of the equipment is already presented as hydrogen-ready, the integration of hydrogen combustion in heating processes still needs adoption and redesign of infrastructure, equipment and the process itself.  HyInHeat realizes the implementation of efficient hydrogen combustion systems to decarbonize heating and melting processes of the aluminium and steel sectors, covering almost their complete process chains. To reach this overarching objective within the project, furnace and equipment like burners or measurement and control technology but also infrastructure is redesigned, modified and implemented in eight demonstrators at technical centres and industrial plants. Besides hydrogen-air heating, oxygen-enriched combustion and hydrogen-oxyfuel heating is implemented to boost energy efficiency and to decrease the future hydrogen fuel demand of the processes. This might result in a total redesign of the heating process itself which will be supported by simulation methods enhancing digitalisation along the value chain. Since critical production processes are converted, it is a fundamental requirement to maintain product quality and yield. Priority is also given to the refractory lining to prove sustainability. From an environmental perspective, new concepts for NOx emission measurement in hydrogen combustion off-gas are developed. Material flow analysis and life cycle analysis methods will support the comprehensive cross-sectorial evaluation, which allows the determination of the potential for the implementation of hydrogen heating processes in energy intensive industry. With these activities, HyInHeat contributes to the objectives of decreasing CO2 emission of the processes while increasing energy efficiency in a cost competitive way keeping NOx emission levels and resource efficiency at least at the same level.",2023-03-17 15:29:07,10.3030/101091456,Integration of hydrogen for replacing fossil fuels in industrial applications (Processes4Planet Partnership) (IA),"Climate Neutral, Circular and Digitised Production","manufacturing technologies,advanced materials,low carbon and clean industries"

However, when considering the application of such functionalisation in complex industrial parts, several challenges must be faced. The difficulty of reaching all surfaces of complex 3D parts is significative, especially in those with considerable size and weight. At the same time, uncertainty about the regulatory compliance of functionalised parts in some sectors makes a straightforward integration of this process more difficult. As a result, this limits the potential of some companies in terms of opening up new markets or attaining a competitive edge. Additionally, the creation of functional surfaces has traditionally relied on processes such as chemical reactions and/or the complete coating of the native surfaces (e.g. aerofoils). Due to their very nature, these processes generate unwanted by-products thereby leaving a significant environmental footprint, which go against the â€œdo no significant harmâ€ principle of The European Green Deal.

At infrastructure level, the project brings visibility to distributed edge and Cloud resources by developing Dynamic Graph Models capable of capturing and visualising the real-time and historic status information, connectivity types, dependencies, energy consumption etc. from diverse edge and Cloud resources. The graph models are used by AI (Graph Neural Networks - GNN) models and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to suggest the optimal deployment configurations for hyper distributed applications considering their specific needs. The AI (GNN and DRL) models are packaged as an intelligent decision-making engine that can replace the scheduling component of open-source solutions such as KubeEdge. This will enable real-time and predictive management of distributed infrastructure and applications. To take full advantage of the potential (compute, storage, energy efficiency etc) opportunities in the CCC, ENACT will develop an innovative Application Programming Model (APM). The APM will support the development of distributed platform agnostic applications, capable of self-determining their optimal deployment and optimal execution configurations while taking advantage of diverse resources in the CCC. An SDK to develop APM-based distributed applications will be developed. Moreover, services for automatic (zero-touch provisioning-based) resource configuration and (telemetry) data collections are developed to help design and update dynamic graph models.

Data-driven applications using AI techniques are reshaping various industries such as manufacturing, tourism, and mobility. The European Strategy for Data aims to create a single market for data while ensuring Europe's global competitiveness and data sovereignty. This has led to the development of Common European data spaces, yet the governance of the data life cycle in organizations has not kept up with the rapid technology evolution and remains largely manual. This is especially evident in scenarios where tens or hundreds of continuously evolving data sources produce semi-structured data, and create significant challenges when governed manually, causing organizations to end up with data silos. A systematic and standardized mechanism is needed to ingest, integrate, and process data, thus boosting the ability to develop new data-centric business models. However, current research and development efforts typically target one aspect of the end-to-end data lifecycle, such as scalable data management, ML performance, AI explainability, or sharing, while dismissing its governance.

Therefore, novel distributed computing paradigms, such as edge and fog computing emerged to support processing data closer to its origin. However, such hyper-distributed systems require fundamentally new methods.  To overcome the limitation of current centralised application management approaches, Swarmhestrate will develop a completely novel decentralised application-level orchestrator, based on the notion of self-organised interdependent Swarms. Application microservices are managed in a dynamic Orchestration Space by decentralised Orchestration Agents, governed by distributed intelligence that provides matchmaking between application requirements and resources, and supports the dynamic self-organisation of Swarms. Knowledge and trust, essential for the operation of the Orchestration Space, will be managed through blockchain-based trusted solutions using methods of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and Distributed Identifiers (DID). End-to-end security of the overall system will be assured by utilising state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms and privacy preserving data analytics.  Due to the imminent complexity of the decentralised system, novel simulation approaches will be developed to test and optimise system behaviour (e.g., energy efficiency) in the early stages of development. Additionally, the simulator will be further extended into a digital twin running in parallel to the physical system and improving its behaviour with predictive feedback.

Most of all, robots lack the cognitive capabilities to understand a task to the point of being able to perform it in a different domain. As humans, during the learning process we gain deep insights on the execution of a process, which allows us to replicate its execution in a different domain with a little effort. We are also able to invert the task execution and to react to contingencies, by focusing the attention to the most critical prediction phases. However, replicating these cognitive processes in AI-driven robots is challenging as it needs a profound rethinking of the robot learning paradigm itself. The robot needs to understand how to act and imagine, like humans do, the possible consequences of its actions in another domain. This demands for a novel framework that embraces different levels of abstraction, starting from physical interaction with the environment, passing through active perception and understanding, and ending-up with decision-making. The INVERSE project aims to provide robots with these essential cognitive abilities by adopting a continual learning approach. After an initial bootstrap phase, used to create initial knowledge from human-level specifications, the robot refines its repertoire by capitalising on its own experience and on human feedback. This experience-driven strategy permits to frame different problems, like performing a task in a different domain, as a problem of fault detection and recovery. Humans have a central role in INVERSE, since their supervision helps limit the complexity of the refinement loop, making the solution suitable for deployment in production scenarios.

The goal of the project is to develop sustainable and safe materials that can be used in a wide range of applications such as biosensors, conductive ink, and EMI shielding. The SAFARI project begins with the preparation of precursor compounds known as MAX phases. These compounds are then used to produce two types of MXenes (Ti3C2 and Cr2C) which are further functionalized to enhance their properties and increase their affinity with Graphene. The resulting 2D hybrid materials are created using two different methods, and their structural, morphological, and functional properties are thoroughly examined. One of the main strengths of the SAFARI project is that is allinged with the SSbD principles. Thus assessment of the toxicological and eco-toxicological profiles of the new materials through a range of tests and assays will be conducted.

Then debunking modules will be developed, for each type of modality, based on AI and ML methods that could detect and examine questionable content, by comparing it to the context extracted from the knowledge graphs. RNN, CNN, multi-modal language interpretation, and transformers methods will be used to that extent. The goal of such modules is to give a score of fakeness, which we will call Disinofscore, for content given as input. The API will then integrate this method and will be the bases of the 4 interfaces abovementioned. The plugin will allow people to be instantly noticed when a content they are considering is fake or true, the collaborative platform - also called Disinfopedia, will allow more proactive online users to report questionable content, that will be checked by a debunking committee chaired by a senior analyst, the app interface will allow people to check content in their everyday life, while the AR interface will allow citizens to have hindsight on the incoming generation of fake news and social media.""",2023-11-23 09:38:46,,Through AI from Disinformation to Trust (IA),A Human-Centred and Ethical Development of Digital and Industrial Technologies,"artificial intelligence,extended reality,augmented reality,virtual reality"

We derive inspiration from each other, solve problems and chart our future together. Yet our interaction with fellow humans is far from seamless or frictionless: despite much greater world-wide reach, we suffer (perhaps more than ever) from isolation, barriers and separation due to language, culture, physical distances, time-zones, scheduling conflicts, and distractions to our attention. With greater freedom, reach and flexibility, our isolation and complexities also appear to increase. In our proposed project â€œMeetweenâ€, we aim to find solutions to these problems. Rather than artificial intelligence (AI) getting in the way of the human experience, we harness its power to make human-human interaction more seamless and natural, eliminate language barriers, replace the techno-clutter with support. The project aims to 1) build the science-based technology solutions needed to power the next generation of videoconferencing platforms for Europe, to support smooth, engaging, barrier-free collaboration across languages; 2) exploit the all-round, integrated algorithmic capabilities offered by foundation models and self-supervised training on large datasets to nimbly adapt to participant context, cultural and regional specificities, including linguistic ones; 3) foster and facilitate business collaboration throughout the European Union by providing real-time machine-learning-powered speech-to-speech translation, summarization and virtual assistant services for online meetings; 4) defend a European vision for AI with regard to safety, privacy, social and ethical approaches, anchored in our regulations, data standards and shared initiatives and resources.",2023-11-06 14:26:06,,Natural Language Understanding and Interaction in Advanced Language Technologies (AI Data and Robotics Partnership) (RIA),A Human-Centred and Ethical Development of Digital and Industrial Technologies,artificial intelligence

It is expected that the emerging sustainable AI methods can be efficiently deployed in the edge-cloud continuum on different hardware platforms and computing infrastructure depending on the real-world task scenarios and constraints including the limited energy budget. In response to this growing demand and emerging trends we propose to adopt a brain-like approach to AI system design due to its promising potential for functional flexibility, hardware friendliness as well as energy efficiency among others. To this end, EXTRA-BRAIN is aimed at developing a new generation of AI solutions based on brain-like neural networks that enable us to overcome key limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods, exemplified by deep learning, such as limited cross-task generalisation and extrapolation to novel domains (bounded reliability), excessive dependence on costly annotated data as well as extensive training and validation processes with heavy demand for compute resources at high energy cost, to name a few. The core brain-like neural network design in our approach derives from the accumulated computational neuroscience insights into the brain's working principles of information processing, key learning schemes and neuroanatomical structures that underlie the brain's perceptual/cognitive phenomena and its functional flexibility. Furthermore, these novel models are supported by data optimisation pipelines, which improve data quality, security and reduce the costs of assembling suitable training data, and an explainability framework to empower the human user.

Massive quantities of data produced by IoT devices revolutionize the way such ecosystems operate via the exploitation of AI models/services. This has led to the emergence of the so-called Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) systems. In general, designing techniques to promote robustness, efficiency and continual operation of AIoT systems requires realistic and trustworthy data at scale. However, such data is not always easy to obtain due to the cost of smart space construction, the inconvenience of long-term device tracking, the sensor/knowledge data gaps in diverse scenarios of a smart space, and the restrictions imposed on sensitive data sharing. Furthermore, an efficient AIoT system operation requires trustworthy AI services, as well as novel approaches for speeding up their inference across the IoT-Edge/Cloud continuum.

A better understanding on how specific aspects, such as plausibility (the illusion that virtual events are really happening), co-presence (the illusion of being with others), or place illusion (the feeling of being there) impact XR experiences is key to improve their quality. The availability and performance of current technologies do not reach high levels of presence in XR, which is essential to get us closer than ever to the perennial VR dream: to be anywhere, doing anything, together with others, from any place. PRESENCE will impact multiple dimensions of presence in physical-digital worlds, addressing three main challenges: i) how to create realistic visual interactions among remote humans, delivering high-end holoportation based on live volumetric capturing, compression and optimization techniques, under heterogeneous computation and network conditions; ii) how to provide realistic touch among remote users and synthetic objects, developing novel haptic systems and enabling spatial multi device synchronisation in multi user scenarios; iii) how to produce realistic social interactions among avatars and agents, generating AI virtual humans, representing actual users or AI agents. PRESENCE will ensure the future uptake of research results following a threefold evaluation method: 1) each technology will be independently evaluated to understand its impact on the illusion of presence; 2) each component will be evaluated by the integration team, providing scientific and technical feedback in order to facilitate their use in each project iteration as well as beyond the project scope, towards technology transfer and exploitation; 3) all components will be integrated in two demonstrators (professional and social setups), following a human-centred design approach and ultimately evaluating the user experience.",2023-11-03 12:04:21,,Next Generation eXtended Reality (RIA),A Human-Centred and Ethical Development of Digital and Industrial Technologies,"extended reality,virtual reality,artificial intelligence"

However, access to the many benefits of musical experience can be limited due to various reasons: (1) the geographic location of the venue, (2) personal limitations in access, (3) limitation on the schedule of the concerts and performances, (4) cost of the experience. Due to these limitations the effort and cost of getting access to the concerts and performances override additional value the participant would get from the experiences. In XTREME project, we remove these limitations by developing a human-centered mixed reality (MR) solution that, instead of requiring the participant to be physically present in the venue, brings the concerts and performances to a remote location via MR technology while retaining the immersive experience, and even giving additional dimensions to it by integrating real and virtual contents. Our solution also allows for virtually shared, realistic experience together with selected social circles of the user. The solution removes geographic limitations as by the MR solution the concerts and performances can be accessed virtually from anywhere and they hence are more inclusive for people with limited access. Likewise, providing a global access to the art and music provides a wider audience for musicians and artists, not limiting the number of seats by the size of the physical venue. As this solution removes the necessity to travel to concerts and performances, it also provides a greener alternative. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our solution targets at making an MR solution to the concerts and performances where those are in in 3D, both for visuals and sound, blended into the room of the users. We will also provide maximised experience of presence via reconstruction of the users and their behaviour in the shared access, and enhance the immersion by providing an additional visual layer to the sound.",2023-11-21 16:53:20,,Next Generation eXtended Reality (RIA),A Human-Centred and Ethical Development of Digital and Industrial Technologies,"extended reality,virtual reality,artificial intelligence"

LITHOS expands and tailors the existing Keliber & M:O flowsheet, which was developed for regular-grade spodumene ores, so that (1) the cut-off grade for spodumene ores is reduced, resulting in larger Li reserves, while (2) allowing the commercialisation of lower-grade pegmatite and RMG deposits. LITHOS triggers innovations along the value chain â€“ mineral processing, concentrate pre-treatment & hydrometallurgical refining â€“ making it possible to deal with different levels and types of impurities in non-spodumene Li minerals (lepidolite & petalite). LITHOS gives specific attention to closed-loop water systems in the mineral processing (KPI: 90% less water consumption). The overall CO2 emissions of the LITHOS flowsheet will be 50% lower than todayâ€™s benchmark (production of spodumene concentrate in Australia & refining in China).

Through the domestic extraction of two CRMs â€“ â€œvanadiumâ€ (V) and â€œtitanium metalâ€ (Ti metal) â€“ AVANTIS addresses the first target of the Act (> 10% domestic extraction, for V & Ti). AVANTISâ€™ rationale lies in the fact that Europe has a multitude of unexploited, low-grade V-bearing titanomagnetite deposits in Finland, Sweden, Greenland, Norway, Poland, Ukraineâ€¦ However, these deposits have a complex â€œspiderweb-likeâ€ mineral assemblage. Without selective blasting, selective fragmentation and pre-concentration technologies to separate the Ti-rich ilmenite grains from the V-bearing magnetite, it is uneconomic to exploit these deposits. Supported by a bespoke forensic geometallurgy approach, AVANTIS develops a novel selective blasting approach that allows for rock excavation in view of increased mineral liberation at the blasting stage, and reduced energy demand in the crushing & grinding stages. Likewise, AVANTIS designs tailored, water-free and water-lean pre-concentration technologies that allow to produce two distinct pre-concentrates ((1) ilmenite-rich, Ti-pre-concentrate and (2) ilmenite-free, V-pre-concentrate). The water-lean method is also tailored to process V/Ti-bearing mining wastes from historical/on-going operations. The resulting flowsheets have a low net water consumption (> 70% water recycling) and reduced GHG intensity of extraction (reduction of 60â€“700 g CO2,eq per t ore hauled to the crushing plant). A preliminary analysis of the potential European reserves that are unlocked, yields a total of 154 Mt Ti & 3.5 Mt V (still excluding Ukraine), to be compared with current levels of EU consumption (1.5 Mt/y Ti; 12.7 kt/y V).

However due to a sharp rise in costs and an emerging shortage of xenon, significant impacts on the economics of certain future mission profiles such as those planned for the replacement of current geostationary (GEO) telecommunication satellites are expected. It is thus necessary to seek alternative more abundant and cheaper propellant alternatives such as krypton. However, today there is no European thruster available on the market in the range 2.5 to 5 kW qualified to be used with krypton. The replacement of xenon by krypton would normally require a full qualification comprising many hours years of ground testing to be performed prior to obtain the â€˜ready for flightâ€™ status as required by the current ECSS standards.

However, the presence of different contaminants, mainly coming from the emissions of our own Galaxy, constitutes one of the major limiting factors to constrain reliably the existence of the B-modes. Indeed, the success of future CMB polarization experiments lies in the improved understanding and removal capability of foreground emissions.RadioForegrounds+ will provide a state-of-the art description of the highly complex properties of the polarised radio emission from our Galaxy, in particular the synchrotron and the anomalous microwave emissions, as well as of the population of radio sources.

Climate attribution, which examines the causal links between extreme events, natural variability, and anthropogenic climate change, can help to unravel this complexity and thereby promote societal preparedness and awareness for climate change impacts. The COMPASS project aims to develop a harmonised, yet flexible, methodological framework for climate and impact attribution of various hazard types. COMPASS will go beyond the current frameworks by bridging the gap from the attribution of single-driver extremes to the attribution of more complex extremes (that is compound, sequences and cascading hazard events) and enabling a shift from a hazard-centred analysis to an impact-centred perspective. Main novelties include event-based hazard and impact modelling using a multi-scale approach, the use of weather type analysis for better understanding the physical drivers that give rise compound extremes, and the use of contextualized storylines to communicate attribution results. The framework will be validated and applied to a set of use cases that cover historical extremes for various hazard types and impact context as well as extreme events happening during the project.

The SCARBOn system is based on a constellation of small greenhouse gases (GHG) monitoring satellites, flying an innovative miniaturised CO2/CH4 instrument (NanoCarb) together with a coregistered compact aerosol sensor (SPEXone). Together, they will deliver twice-daily accurate global measurements to monitor the diurnal variations of fossil CO2 emission.The objective of the SCARBOn project is to mature the technical and industrial definition of the NanoCarb instrument and of the SCARBOn constellation, targeting an operational system availability before the end of the decade. The design of the NanoCarb instrument will be upgraded and refined following the outcomes of the previous SCARBO study, and its performances will be carefully modelled. An instrument breadboard will provide valuable data during an airborne campaign, which will be used together with modelled data to verify the instrument design. This will allow raising the instrument TRL to at least 5, targeting 6 by the end of the project. Data processing at levels L1 to L4 will validate the concept capability to monitor GHG plumes from space. The constellation concept will also be refined in view of a possible short-term industrial implementation.SCARBOnâ€™s daily CO2 and CH4 anthropogenic emissions monitoring data, based on novel European breakthrough technologies, will be a valuable contributor to the European Commissionâ€™s endeavour to fight climate change.

The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS, https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu) exploits the information content of Earth-Observation data to monitor the composition of the atmosphere. By combining satellite observations with numerical modelling by means of data assimilation and inversion techniques, CAMS provides in near-real time a wealth of information to answer questions related to air quality, climate change and air pollution and its mitigation, energy, agriculture, etc. CAMS provides both global atmospheric composition products, using the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of ECMWF - hereafter denoted the global production system - , and regional European products, provided by an ensemble of eleven regional models - the regional production system. The CAMS AERosol Advancement (CAMAERA) project will provide strong improvements of the aerosol modelling capabilities of the regional and global systems, on the assimilation of new sources of data, and on a better representation of secondary aerosols and their precursor gases. In this way CAMAERA will enhance the quality of key products of the CAMS service and therefore help CAMS to better respond to user needs such as air pollutant monitoring, along with the fulfilment of sustainable development goals. To achieve this purpose CAMAERA will develop new prototype service elements of CAMS, beyond the current state-of-art. It will do so in very close collaboration with the CAMS service providers, as well as other tier-3 projects.

ELECTRA develops and validates in real life emission-free, electrically heated cement and lime production process in MW scale capable of reaching temperature up to 2000Â°C. By using low-emission electricity instead of combustion for decomposing calcium carbonate, and by capturing the carbon dioxide produced in the production process, it is possible to run a cement plant with close to zero carbon dioxide emissions providing even negative-emission cement and lime products for the society. Successful implementation of ELECTRA will eliminate fuel-related CO2-emissions from the industries targeted by 30-50% of total process emissions, depending on the industry and mode of operation. Scalability and replicability is showcased by the platform-based solutions offering modularity, and the possibility is there to run in various hybrid modes in a transition period, lowering initial CAPEX. They allow for both new electric installations and revamping of old ones. Platform-based modular automation practices can potentially accelerate electrification by up to 5 years. Different applications also require different properties for lime and therefore variations of electrically heated processes are developed to support and complement MW scale demonstration.Replacing combustion processes with electricity-based solutions and significantly increasing emission-free electricity production is an effective means of mitigating climate change. As one of the ingredients for concrete, cement is the world's most used building material and globally the largest CO2 emitter of all industrial sectors.

This means that a process that previously produced high emissions can become absolutely emission-free when powered by renewable energy.The aim of the CITADEL project is to substitute fossil combustion processes with innovative electric technologies, such as electric resistance heating, microwave heating and plasma heating. Five use cases are considered, targeting the production of refractory bricks, glass and copper wires, preheating processes in steel production and the recycling of concrete. For these specific applications, appropriate demonstration plants have to be designed, built, tested close to the process and validated.

This is crucial for the EU to achieve its 2050 target of climate neutrality as energy-intensive industries (EIIs) are responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions. eLITHE will demonstrate three different electric furnaces (a frit smelter based electrodes and induction, a microwave-powered alumina calciner and a hybrid brick firing tunnel kiln for combined use of electricity and hydrogen burning) at three pilot sites. Besides, eLITHE will develop novel material compositions compatible with the electric heating, research circular materials for their use high temperature energy storage applications  and create digital tools to enhance process energy management and enable a safe and sustainable operation. The project consortium consists of 18 partners from 9 EU countries, with diversified expertise and knowledge in the addressed processes. The project will have a significant impact on the clean energy transition of EIIs and will lead to a reduction of over 97,000 tons of CO2 per year and over 505 GWh/yr of natural gas use for a full-scale unit replaced, contributing to reducing EU dependence on fossil-fuels imports. In addition to the direct impact on the clean energy transition of the ceramic industry, eLITHE will also have broader societal and economic impacts. The project will contribute to the development of a sustainable and circular economy, supporting the creation of green jobs and improving the competitiveness of European industries. The project's focus on electrification technologies and renewable energy integration will also contribute to the development of a more resilient and secure energy system for the EU, reducing its dependence on imported fossil fuels.",2024-01-08 20:32:09,,Electrification of high temperature heating systems (Processes4Planet Partnership) (IA),"Climate Neutral, Circular and Digitised Production","manufacturing technologies,low carbon and clean industries,advanced materials,circular industries"

The progression of these production processes will imply changes in the composition and management of generated by-products, especially for those containing Zn. Likewise, the large rate of fossil fuels/reductants needed in the current valorisation processes of these wastes make them very intensive in terms of CO2 emissions, requiring the metallurgical industry to move to H2 applications in its targeted pathway towards zero wastes goal. To tackle with these complex challenges and to solve the recycling of key steelmaking by-products like EAF dust, BOF dust and sludges, DR sludge and pellet fines and mill scales (among others), ZHYRON will develop an innovative valorisation route for Fe-rich and Zn-containing by-products based on the combination of pyrometallurgical (using green H2 as reductant) and hydrometallurgical stages The iron oxides units would be recovered as Direct Reduced Iron able to be consumed in EAF and the zinc would be recovered as zinc oxide concentrate to be used in zinc smelting sector, contributing thus to circular economy and industrial symbiosis approaches.The proposed technologies will be developed and endorsed at lab pilot scale (TRL6), and the obtained circular products will be validated by testing and characterization analysis. ZHYRON will also examine solutions regarding technical integration, economic and environmental criteria, contributing to the development of novel business models, guidelines and strategies. ZHYRON has been structured in 6 WP, combining R&D activities, project management and dissemination activities, and gathering a competitive consortium of 9 partners from 6 EU countries. If the solutions are successful, the benefits will include avoiding landfill of dangerous wastes, reduction in the CO2 emissions and the implementation of a new circular economy loop.",2024-01-17 13:38:08,,"Circular economy solutions for the valorisation of low-quality scrap streams, materials recirculation with high recycling rate, and residue valorisation for long term goal towards zero waste (Clean Steel Partnership) (RIA)","Climate Neutral, Circular and Digitised Production","low carbon and clean industries,circular industries"

A hybrid production where complex components using LPBFâ€™s flexibility are built on top of conventionally manufactured substrates at near-net-shape geometry can speed up the production process dramatically, especially if applied to small component volumes. global-AM aims to advance and combine existing state-of-the-art approaches, namely beam shaping, beam splitting, in-situ geometry correction, and process monitoring + control in an advanced machine concept that allows fixation of multiple substrates and laser beam positioning to produce components on a large scale. As a demonstrator, a cooling device for power electronics is chosen because it combines typical challenges in a prototypic way: complex metal geometries made from challenging materials such as copper are built on a ceramic-based substrate with a required precision in the low micrometer scale. If the technological barriers towards the demonstrator can be solved, global-AM will introduce â€“ but not limit â€“ LPBF to the multi-billion euro mass market of power electronics with highly attractive technological, economical, and environmental benefits To make this project successful, experts from renowned universities and world-leading companies in the disciplines of production technology, laser systems, process development/monitoring/control, and modeling, as well as powder production for advanced multi-material powders, join their efforts in close multi-national cooperation.",2024-01-18 14:08:57,,High-precision OR complex product manufacturing – potentially including the use of photonics (Made in Europe and Photonics Partnerships) (IA),"Climate Neutral, Circular and Digitised Production","emerging enabling technologies,advanced materials"
